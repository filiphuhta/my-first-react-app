I have used the introcution to React tutorial, to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React. Which I have styled with boostrap.

## Get started

In the project directory, you need to run:

### 1. `npm install` (Install node_modules)

### 2. `npm start` (Start the project, Runs the app in the development mode.)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
